/*

Vector, 3-components, and Matrix, 3x3 components.

usual methods on same, operating in-place, not returning reference, so no single line chained functions.

arrays of both, Vectors and Matrices, with their usual methods.

separate package adding many methods swizzled.

operations are selectively parallel.

arrays selectively broken into chunks for optimised parallelization.
