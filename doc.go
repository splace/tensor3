/*

Vector, 3-components, and Matrix, 3x3 components.

many useful methods on same, operating in-place, not returning reference, so no single line chained functions.

arrays of both, Vectors and Matrices, with their useful methods.

methods are often bascially shorthand/self-documentation for the underlying general solution. 

separate package adding many methods swizzled.

operations are selectively parallel.

arrays selectively broken into chunks for optimised parallelization.
